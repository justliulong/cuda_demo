This project is built and tested under the EndeavorOS(arch series) operating system. The graphics card driver needs to be installed and compiled according to the corresponding CUDA version:

## NVIDIA Driver
```shell
yay -S nvidia-dkms nvidia-utils nvidia-settings
```

## CUDA
```shell
yay -S cuda
```
It is usually installed together with cudnn
```shell
yay -S cudnn
```
Check if the installation was successfulï¼š

```shell
nvcc -V

# The output is similar to the following
